                <h3>Shield</h3>
                <p>Captain America's shield is his main weapon. The best known of his shields is a disk-shaped object
                    with
                    a pentagram design at its center, within concentric blue, red, and white circles. This shield is
                    composed of a unique combination of Vibranium, alloy steel, and an unknown third catalyst, which
                    has never been duplicated, called Proto-Adamantium. It is practically indestructible. </p>

                <h3>Mjolnir</h3>
                <p>Mjolnir is Thor's enchanted warhammer. It was forged from Uru in the heart of a dying star in
                    Nidavellir, and according to Odin himself, it served as a tool to help Thor himself harness his
                    thunder powers. Odin mentioned that anyone who wears Mjolnir will possess the power of Thor</p>
